			<h3>Background</h3>
			<p>In 1900, a Chinese group known as the Militia United in Righteousness (called <i>boxers</i> in English)
			started an uprising against the growing spheres of influence in China (France, UK, Germany, Russia, Japan). The Open Door Policy was also in effect, allowing for even
			more countries to spread in China.</p><img src="download.jpg" alt="Army in China">

			<h3>US Involvement and Aftermath</h3>
			<p>The US, allied to the Spheres but not one of them, joined the fight. They helped to quickly put down the Boxers and signed the Boxer Rebellion which called 
			for executions of Chinese officals who assisted the Boxers and $330M dollars (~$10B today) in war repartions.</p><img src="Boxer_Rebellion.jpg" alt="War Cartoon" width="700px">
